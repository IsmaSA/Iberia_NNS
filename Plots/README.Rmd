# Description:

In this folder, you will find Figures 1 and 2, used in the manuscript in an interactive way (.html). To visualise (and interact) with the figures you need to download the files.

- Files ending with 'Sunburst' refer to Figure 1
- Files starting with 'flow' refer to Figure 2

_Files may change in the future according to the database_


Note to me: I need to include also the plotly.js and htmlwidgets.js from the folder I created Andorra_path_files
